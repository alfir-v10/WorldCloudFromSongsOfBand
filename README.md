# WorldCloudFromSongsOfBand

I parsed the page of the most famous [platform](https://www.amalgama-lab.com/) in Russia for translating songs into russian.

This file allows you to extract all the songs of your favorite band from the site, and build a [word cloud](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/).
